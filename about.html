       My name is Mathew Deion. I am currently a student at the University of Rhode Island. My major is in <br>
       accounting and I am planning on minoring in computer programming, hence my decison to take this course! <br>
       My goal is to obtain a bachelor's degree, followed by a master's degree in order to sit for the CPA <br>
       exam.</font></p>

       Some of my favorite hobbies are playing video games and collecting action figures. Over the years, I <br>
       have ammassed a collection mostly comprised of LEGO sets, LEGO Bionicle figures, Transformer figures, <br>
       and many other things! I also enjoy reading books, watching movies, and maintaining a regular workout <br>
       routine at my gym.</font></p>
